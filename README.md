Mini-projects for the Deep Learning class (NLP, DRL), Master MVA, ENS Paris-Saclay.

1) Mini-Project on Natural Language Processing
* Word embeddings
* Sentence classification with BoV and scikit-learn
* Sentence classification with LSTMs in Keras

2) Mini-Project on Deep Reinforcement Learning

By using the Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm, an agent is trained to learn from scratch a policy that maximizes its reward (a rat needs to collect cheese, while avoiding poisonous cells).
